# Purpose
There's plenty of implementations of commonly used algorithms already, why another? 

The purpose of this project is to try to provide the simplest, most elegant solutions. Most algorithms are implemented in different languages, such as Javascript and Java. On the other hand, applications that solve real problems are also included to show how to use certain algorithms in real world.
